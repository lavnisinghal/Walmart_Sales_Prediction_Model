# Walmart_Sales_Prediction_Model
In this project, we conduct a comprehensive and detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Walmart's annual sales data to uncover underlying trends and insights. 
By diving deep into the dataset, we aim to identify patterns and address any inconsistencies that could impact the accuracy of our predictions.

Our analysis is designed to inform the development of a robust prediction model, capable of forecasting future sales with greater accuracy. 
To achieve this, we employ a Random Forest Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model based on the insights gained from our analysis. 
This model is intended to forecast sales for the coming years, leveraging the training data to make informed predictions.
